<h4 class="post-title">What is korean beauty?</h4>
<div class="post-content">
<p>If we had to name one Korean beauty trend that has takenover the skin care world, glass skin easily takes that top spot. And it makes perfect sense. Everyone loves clear and healthy-looking skin, and the glass skin trend does just that. Glass skin is meant to evoke the idea of a crystal clear piece of glass, meaning it’s all about skin that looks completely clear. Poreless, dewy, baby-soft skin is the ultimate goal.

<h3>1.Wash your face with rice water</h3>
<br>
<div class="post-girl">

</div>
<p> Supposedly this is one of Asia’s earliest known “beauty hacks.” It’s been said that female rice farmers bathed and washed their hair in rice water due to its highly nourishing content, a combination of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Luckily for us, this has to be one of the simplest beauty home remedies in the world.
<br>
<br>Start by rinsing the rice clean. Follow up by letting the rice soak in clean water for at least 15 minutes. Strain the rice water and use it to wash your face after your double cleanse, or just as a normal cleanser, making sure not to rinse it off so your skin gets all the benefits. If you want to use it in your hair, use as a rinse or conditioner after shampooing. You can also refrigerate the rice water for about a week.

I've seen korean grandma's who look younger than me. Their secret? They use a nubby washcloth to massage Their face every day, using upward moving, circular strokes.

<h3>3. Try a facial massage!</h3>
<div class="post-massage">
<p>I remember the first time I found out about facial massages. I was absolutely perplexed. What good could a facial massage possibly do? As it turns out, massaging your face may actually have some anti-aging benefits. Facial massages are supposed to improve circulation and encourage lymph drainage, leaving skin looking young and healthy.

</div>
<p>This is such a simple Korean skincare hack that you can start today! To prevent dryness in your room, damp towels come in handy. After taking a shower, hang your wet towel in your room as a humidifier to maintain moisture in the dry months of winter. Hydration is key to supple and baby-like skin! Many people in Korea even hang wet towel around the room while they sleep to keep hydration in the air.
